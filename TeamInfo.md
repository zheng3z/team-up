## Project Summary

Our team proposes a teammate matching platform. On this platform, instructors can assign students to groups randomly or allow students to form their own groups. On the student's side, they can view their teams and their group members’ contact information. When self-assigned groups are allowed, students can submit their team information through this website. They can also post teammates finding announcements or look up messages to join a team. After teams are formed, instructors can view and download all teams’ information.
